For the simulation part:
Using the file **Simulation ver3.R** to run the simulation part. 
The other source files: **redraw_choices_from_data.R**, **build_par_from_mod.R**, and **substract_choice_regressor_from_data.R** need to be input in the file **Simulation ver3.R** to run some functions
These files are original from prof. Dietmar Bauer and his team in their package **Rprobit** with some modification to be suitable with the thesis project.
