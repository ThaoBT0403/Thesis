For the simulation part:
Using the file **Simulation ver3.r** to run the simulation part. 
The other source files: **redraw_choices_from_data.r**, **build_par_from_mod.r**, and **substract_choice_regressor_from_data.r** need to be input in the file **Simulation ver3.r** to run some functions
For the application part:
Using **Application_helveston USA.r **and **Application_helveston China.r**. Actually, the two R files are identical but the number of decision-makers in the calibration and evaluation subsets in the two countries are different. So, just using two file to make it more clear.
To run those R files, it is necessary to import input data files **helveston_data_wide.RData** and **helveston_data_wide_china.RData**
and input the R file **substract_choice_regressor_from_data.r** to have some functions.
